  "scenario": "A high-value intelligence asset has been compromised and is being held in an enemy-controlled urban district. The team must infiltrate, locate, and extract the asset while navigating incomplete intelligence, civilian populations, communication blackouts, and multiple threat vectors. Success requires constant threat assessment, adaptive planning, and mission-critical decision-making under pressure. The operation window is limited - enemy forces are consolidating their position and the asset's value decreases with every hour of delay.",
