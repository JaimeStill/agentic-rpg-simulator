# Simulate Adventure: Thai Romance Healing

Execute the complete adventure simulation workflow automatically.

## Adventure Context
**Theme:** Thai Romantic Drama - Contemporary romance with Thai cultural elements  
**Scenario:** A humble and successful but troubled man who frequents a Thai restaurant after work falls in love with the waitress who regularly serves him. Their developed bond brings them both healing and sets them on a beautiful journey together.

## Automated Execution Workflow

I will now execute the complete adventure simulation process:

### Phase 1: Character Subagent Setup
Converting character profiles to runtime subagents for authentic character behavior during events.

**Converting Character Profiles:**
- Reading JSON character profiles from ../characters/
- Generating runtime subagents in .claude/agents/runtime/thai-romance-healing-20250802/
- Characters will be available for invocation during event processing

### Phase 2: Event State Detection and Initialization
Checking current adventure state and determining next event to process.

**Event State Analysis:**
- Scanning ../events/ directory for existing event states
- Determining current event number and adventure progress
- Loading latest world state and character conditions
- Initializing next event based on current state

### Phase 3: Event Processing with Character Subagent Participation
Executing the next adventure event with authentic character responses through dedicated subagents.

**Event Structure:**
- **Event Setup**: Describe situation, stakes, and context within token budget
- **Character Actions**: Invoke each character subagent to get authentic responses to the situation
- **Mechanic Resolution**: Process character actions through appropriate game mechanics
- **World Impact**: Determine consequences and changes to adventure state

**Character Subagent Invocation Protocol:**
During character action phases, I will use the Task tool to invoke each character subagent by name.
Each subagent will respond authentically based on their personality, goals, and current situation.

### Phase 4: Character Evolution Processing
Automatically extracting character growth from subagent responses and updating persistent profiles.

**Evolution Extraction Process:**
- Analyzing subagent responses for character development indicators
- Identifying relationship changes, goal evolution, and tactical adaptations
- Extracting specific character growth elements
- Updating persistent JSON character profiles in ../characters/
- Refreshing runtime subagents with evolved character state

### Phase 5: State Persistence and Logging
Saving complete adventure state and creating detailed event transcript.

**State Management:**
- Saving updated event state to ../events/event-[X]-state.json
- Creating detailed event transcript in ../logs/event-[X].md
- Preparing next event setup for adventure continuation

## Execution Begins Now

I am now executing this complete workflow automatically. The adventure will process the next event with full character subagent participation, evolution tracking, and state persistence.
