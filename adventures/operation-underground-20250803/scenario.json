  "scenario": "Elite special forces team DELTA-7 must infiltrate cartel-controlled underground tunnel networks near Juarez to rescue multiple groups of hostages held in fortified prison cells. Intelligence indicates a narrow window before the hostages are moved deeper into Mexico. The labyrinthine tunnels are rigged with alarms, the cartel has superior numbers, and any mistake could trigger an international incident. Success requires precise coordination, resource management, and split-second tactical decisions.",
